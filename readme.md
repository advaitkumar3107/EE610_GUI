# GUI for Image Processing #
This contains the code for the assignment 1 of the course EE610: Image Processing held in the Autumn 2021 semester. To 
run the GUI, you need to first install the requirements if not present. The requirements are stated in the 
requirements.txt file. 
Run the following command
<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

This will install all the requirements. The main GUI code can then be run by executing:
<pre><code>py main.py
</code></pre>

The functionalities of the GUI as well as the usage of various image processing techniques have been described in the 
[report](EE610_GUI_Assignment%20(1).pdf)
